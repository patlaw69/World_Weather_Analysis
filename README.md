# World Weather Analysis 
Weather Analysis and building of a travel app for customers of 500+ cities around the world.

## Project Overview
In this module, weâ€™ll practice our analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. Successfully completing the tasks will draw on our knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.

## Resources
Python, citipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Google Maps API, Google Places API, OpenWeatherMap API, Jupyter Notebook

## Summary

- The Travel App allows customers to search for locations they want to travel based on their temperature preferences. 

- Once the customers have filtered the database (DataFrame) based on their temperature preferences, a heatmap will be showed to them for the maximum temperature 
for the filtered cities around the world.
